      <p><br>A dreamy, immersive 3d landscape.
        <br><br>
        Dreams. We all have them no matter how big or small. Dreams are vast, boundless, beautiful, and mysterious- just like space. Being heavily based upon stargazing, this surreal landscape transports the viewer to the middle of a plane surrounded by mountains under a cloudy blue night sky. The scene is accompanied by striking constellations and a red moon while ambient music and the sound of whirring wind plays in the background, providing a visual and auditory experience for the viewer. The title “Lay with Me Beneath the Gemini Sky” derives from the fact that the moon phase and constellations shown are based on those present on my birthday (May 23, 2002), with Gemini season falling from May 21 to June 20.<br><br>This piece serves as an invitation to the viewer to pursue and immerse themselves in their dreams and goals and to bask in the beauty of their potential, imagination, and efforts. As you explore the room, please keep these details in mind while allowing yourself to fully submerge yourself in this experience. Once you finish looking around, feel free to visit the virtual reality experience for “Lay with Me Beneath the Gemini Sky”, which will be linked at the exit/entrance of this room. Thank you for visiting this room and our Collective Conscious Showcase, we deeply appreciate your interest and support.

              <h3>Catherine Thy Le</h3>
              <p>As an artist, Catherine avoids confining her abilities into a single box. Digital and traditional mediums are all fair game for her. She uses mediums that attract her attention and those in which she would like to hone in her skills with. The same can be said regarding her subject matter. She creates artwork based off of what captures her eye and piques her interest. Recreation of landscapes, people, objects, all can be rendered through her own personal lens. With her art, Catherine wants to offer the viewer an emotional experience, regardless of how big or small. Whether it be happiness, tranquility, sadness, anger, awe, or comradery, she wants her art to be a capsule for those emotions. Catherine believes that the beauty of art lies within how it is able to connect complete strangers regardless of their identity and background and would like to provide an open and welcoming space like this for individuals in the future. </p>

              <h3>Eddson Jose</h3>
                <p>Nature in its finest and largest form acts as the subject matter for my art. Digital is the medium for which I use to bring nature to a state of simplistic beauty. I incorporate into my visual art techniques such as having a low polygon count on 3D models, a gracious amount of negative space, and ambient music that plays to the references of the objects in its shared space. My process includes the use of low-poly 3D models to represent my subject matter in its most rudimentary yet most efficient way of presenting itself in a digital environment. The large portions of negative space offer the viewer a serene moment in which to contemplate the subject matter. Ambient music serves to add to the perception the intricate and often hidden entities that make nature whole. In my recent projects, I’ve incorporated the mentioned techniques to present art that depicts a binary star and its formation into a Type 1A supernova. Low-poly models were used to create the stars depicted in the visual and the music depicts the three stages that form a supernova making use of contrasts in volume and complexity to distinguish the three stages.
                <br><br>
                A general notion for my art exists at the boundary between the terms natural and artificial. Like the life forms we see in everyday life (e.g. a tree or bird), these life forms evolved to become efficient in gathering necessary resources; a tree growing tall and wide to gather large swathes of sunlight or a bird evolving larger wings to maximize air time while conserving energy to increase hunting time. A low poly model presents itself in its most minimal form to load or render itself within a scene efficiently, quickly, and with the least amount of data. Making use of our auditory senses and the ability of audio to inherently produce a sense of atmosphere and mood we are able to gather more information of our surroundings and paired with visual information we can create more memorable experiences. My practice seeks to present the inclination of natural objects to evolve towards efficiency given their environment by presenting an artificial representation of natural objects in their most efficient forms within a digital environment. In this simple form my art acts to give beauty to an otherwise mundane recreation and surround my subject matter with enough sensory experiences to efficiently create a lasting impression.
